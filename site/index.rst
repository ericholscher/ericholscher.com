Welcome to the home of Eric Holscher on the web. 

I am the co-founder of `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_, 
`Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_,
and `EthicalAds <https://www.ethicalads.io/>`__.

My work has historically been around software documentation,
but lately it has also verged into privacy and open source sustainability.

The main content here is my blog,
which isn't as active as I'd like,
but there are a lot of useful old posts.

I currently live in Bend, Oregon,
and love to explore the outdoors.
Whether on bike or foot,
I spend as much time as possible out and about,
checking out the various beauty that the world holds.

Below you can find out more information about me,
and the various professional projects I'm a part of.
