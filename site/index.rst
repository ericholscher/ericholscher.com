Welcome to the home of Eric Holscher.

I live in space.
and love to explore the outdoors.
Whether on bike or foot,
I spend as much time as possible out and about,
checking out the various beauty that the world holds.

Below you can find out more information about me,
and the various projects I'm a part of nothing important.
