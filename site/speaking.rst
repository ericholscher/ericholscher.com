Speaking
========

I have always had an interest in teaching,
and I believe that conference presentations are one of the best ways to teach in a professional setting.

I believe that speakers should be part of the conference as well as presenting talks.
A lot of the value in conferences comes from the hallways.
If I speak at your conference,
I will also attend.

I am interested in speaking on the following topics:

    * Documentation
    * Read the Docs & Sphinx
    * Django & Python
    * Leading Open Source Projects

If you would like me to speak at your event,
feel free to `email me`_

Documentation as Empathy - Django Birthday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This talk tells the story of how Documentation was a large part of my entry into the tech world.
I relate this to other folks who are trying to get into the tech world,
and how we need to continue to improve documentation to keep them in the industry.
