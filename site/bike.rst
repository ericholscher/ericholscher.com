Bike Touring
============

After my PCT injury,
I wondered what I could use all of my lightweight camping gear for.
I turned to bike touring,
allowing a machine to handle the stress that my foot obviously isn't capable of.

August 24, 2013: First overnight
--------------------------------
Went on my first bike camping trip to `Dodge Park`_

September 7-10, 2013: First Bike Tour, Portland to Eugene
---------------------------------------------------------

This was a delightful ride in the Oregon fall, 
along the `Williamette Valley Scenic Bikeway`_.
I took basically 3 days,
starting with a MAX ride to 158th street in Beaverton.
I then went down to a friend's going away party.

Thoughts
~~~~~~~~

I quite enjoyed bike touring as an endevour.
It feels a lot like thru hiking,
where you have an overarching goal all the time.
Always moving,
always more miles.
I really enjoyed seeing the country by bike,
though the addition of car traffic wasn't a welcome one.

Compared to the wilderness experience of backpacking,
I think I enjoy backpacking more.
I was along a relatively populated area of Oregon though,
so I imagine if I went out east in Oregon I would have a more comperable experience.

The actual scenic bikeway also had a distinct lack of camping.
The camp sites I chose were of dubious legality,
though nobody questioned me when I camped.
As far as I can tell, 
there is a 80+ mile stretch on the scenic bikeway with no official camping options.
This really limited my comfort level,
because I was having to worry about where I would camp each night.
