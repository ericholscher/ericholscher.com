Not sure what documentation tool to choose?
===========================================

Markdown? Asciidoc? reStructuredText?

Python? Ruby? Go? PHP? .Net?

Static Sites? Self-Hosted? SaaS? Roll our own? How much time will it take to set up?

Will the writers like it? Will the engineers use it? Can it do custom themes? Is it maintained? Will the company exist in 3 years?

There are so many different questions that confront you when you're choosing a new documentation process.
You have to not only choose the technology,
but you have to think through the entire integration of the tools into your process.
**You know you need to make a change but you’re paralyzed by uncertainty.**

You’ve tried to learn about these tools,
but there are so many out there.
You've looked through the docs.
You've tried a couple in basic tests.
You've asked for recommendations --
**but you can't figure out what the best option is.**

Imagine knowing exactly what to do next
---------------------------------------

**Imagine this** – Imagine being off the hamster wheel.
Imagine working smarter, not harder.
Imagine seeing those familiar old problems disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Imagine having the confidence to act decisively to integrate a tool into your company.
