Background
-----------

I currently live in Bend, Oregon.

I lived in Portland, Oregon from 2011-2018,
drawn to the beautiful Pacific Northwest by its lovely mountains,
and the west coast tech industry.
In 2019 and 2020,
I tried the digital nomad life,
traveling around the world working.
Then in 2020,
right before COVID,
I settled in Bend, Oregon.

Before moving to Oregon at the end of 2010,
I lived in Lawrence, Kansas from May 2008-Dec 2010.
There I worked at the Lawrence Journal-World,
and got deeply involved in the Django & Python community.

Growing up I lived mostly in Virginia.
I was born in Washington D.C.,
but lived mostly in the Shenandoah Valley through middle school,
and finally in Virginia Beach for high school,
I finished off my time in Virginia in Fredericksburg for college at the University of Mary Washington.

You can read more about my work history in my :doc:`/resume`,
and other hobbies on this site.
