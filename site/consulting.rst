Consulting
==========

I have worked in software documentation since 2010.
My primary projects are:

-  The community site, https://readthedocs.org, which is the `largest`_ open source documentation hosting site in the world.
-  The community conference, `Write the Docs`_, which is the largest community documentation conference in the USA, and growing in Europe.

I help use this experience to help you understand how to leverage
documentation in your business.

Having great documentation lowers your support costs, gets users
onboarded faster, and is a requirement for shipping quality software. 
Integrating documentation into your product process is a great way to enable quality documentation,
and I can help build a culture around documentation in your company.

Reach out to me at eric@ericholscher.com if you'd like to talk more.

My primary offering is a :doc:`Roadmapping Session <roadmap>`,
which will help you figure out what documentation tool to choose and how to implement it.
