Digital Nomad Guide to Puerto Varas, Chile
==========================================

:updated: February 2019

.. note:: Check out `Puerto Varas Wikivoyage <https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Puerto_Varas>`_ for general tourist info.
          This guide focuses on experiencing it as a digital nomad.

Puerto Varas is a lovely little resort town.
It has a population of around 50,000,
but the small, dense downtown has more than you'd expect for that size.
That is mostly because of tourism,
of which the high season is January & February.

There is a good internet,
a decent coworking space (lacima.cl),
and a Santander Work/Cafe (though it heavily blocks internet, including GitHub).

Transit
-------

Buses go everywhere you need to go. 
You can catch them across from the tourist office in downtown.

Weekends

* **Cochamo** is an amazing place that looks like Yosemite. Great for hiking and climbing. **Make reservations for camping in advance in the high season**.
* **Chiloe island** is a laid back place, worth a long weekend
* **Frutillar** is close by (~30 minute bus) with another nice tourist area.
* **Bariloche, Argentina** is just over the border, and you can hike there in a week if you want
