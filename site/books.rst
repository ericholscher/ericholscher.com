So good they can't ignore you

One in books that I love is that they take something I've intuitively understood,
and give me concrete terms and concepts to describe it.
*So good they can't ignore you* does this in the area of careers and entrepreneurship.

It starts off by explaining why "Follow your passion" is bad advice for folks who want a fulfilling career.
It then explains that what you really want is **Control** and **Mission**.
These are the things that make people love jobs that they have;
but these kind of jobs are quite rare.
It required trading **Career Capital** that you have amassed by being great at something,
and in return you can get a job that you really love.

Once you have that job,
you find the passion for the topic,
because you're working at the cutting edge of your field.
This brings the full picture into focus,
and leaves you with a job that you love.

I heartily recommend this book,
as it has lots of examples that clarify the concepts I've touched on above.

The Outsiders

This book covers the unconventional approach of the 8 CEO's with the best stock market returns ever.
I read it at a time when I was trying to understand more how to manage money ('capital allocation'),
and think through decisions around how to business.
This book was a great lesson in going against the common wisdom,
and allowing yourself to start with first principals to make decisions.  


Shoe Dog
--------

I loved this book,
as it tells the story behind the creation of Nike.
I'm a sucker for CEO autobiographies,
and this is one of the best I've read.
It stays fun throughout,
and teaches some good life lessons along the way.
