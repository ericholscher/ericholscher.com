Backpacking
===========

Backpacking is a hobby that I have picked up since moving to the Pacific Northwest. 


Pacific Crest Trail
-------------------

I walked on the Pacific Crest Trail from April 15 - June 16 in 2013. 
I had to come home due to a stress fracture in my third metatarsal in my left foot,
after walking 800 miles.

I have collected my favorite photos `on Flickr`_

Mount St. Helens
----------------

I summitted Mount St. Helens in March of 2013, 
as a training hike for the PCT. 

Mount Hood
----------

I started taking trips around Mount Hood to get my experience in the field. 
I have done a few different trips, 
mainly in 2012.
A popular one was from Top Spur Trailhead to Cairn Basin.
