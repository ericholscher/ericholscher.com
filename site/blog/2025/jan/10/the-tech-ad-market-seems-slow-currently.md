# The tech ad market seems slow currently

With the work we've been doing on [EthicalAds](https://ethicalads.io/),
I see some part of the tech ad market. It definitely feels like things
are slow right now. Starting in Q4 2024, we've seen a [slow down in
advertising](https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2025/01/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2025/#december-advertising-stats)
and a large uptick in turnover in marketing departments.

We've been worried about softness in the market since 2020, but it
finally seems to be starting to hit a bit more. There are some other
signs around the industry that I've seen that show that things are
slowing down.

## Daring Fireball has open slots

Daring Fireball has been someone we've looked up to for a long time.
Between him and [The
Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deck_(advertising_network)), we
were inspired by the idea of high quality, inuntrusive ads.

I've been a reader for a long time, and I've never seen a house on the
site like this:

## ATP podcast softness

I'm also a long-time listener of the [Accidental Tech
Podcast](https://atp.fm/), and they have been talking about a slowdown
in their ad sales for even longer. Probably since mid 2024, they have
even had a few episodes with no ads at all.
