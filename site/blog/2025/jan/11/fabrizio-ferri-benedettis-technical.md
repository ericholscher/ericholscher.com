# [Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti's technical writing predictions for 2025](https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2025/)

[Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti](https://passo.uno/about/) is someone is a
blogged I've enjoyed reading for a while now, and I wanted to highlight
[his post on 2025
predictions](https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2025/).

> The good news is that the job market is going to recover as those
> owners of code progressively realize the limitations that are inherent
> to replacing the folks at the periphery with numb language models,
> something they're already noticing when it comes to coding tasks.
> After a stint of degrowth that has felt way too long, companies will
> seek to grow again in a more sustainable fashion, a trend that will
> carry the need for better documentation with it.
>
> The catch is that life in the periphery of tech will require AI
> augmentation and training. If past job offers emphasized API
> documentation and coding skills, in 2025 tech writers will have to be
> proficient **[operators of AI
> tools](https://passo.uno/ai-tech-writer-examples/)**, both for writing
> in docs-as-code environments as for becoming **[coding
> associates](https://passo.uno/what-is-a-documentation-engineer/)**,
> able to execute docs infrastructure and toolchain work. When done
> well, job interviews will ask writers to be able to use AI in writing
> tests in efficient, innovative ways.

I tend to generally agree with most of his predictions, and hope that
2025 will be a return to growth in the tech writing profession. Docs as
Code and AI are trends I'm also excited about, but I'm not confident
enough yet to publish predictions :)
