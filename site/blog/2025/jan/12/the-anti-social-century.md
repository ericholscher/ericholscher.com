# The Anti-Social Century

I've been a fan of Derek Thompson for a while now, and his podcast
[Plain
English](https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/plain-english-with-derek-thompson).
I'm also excited about his upcoming book
[Abundance](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Abundance/Ezra-Klein/9781668023488)
with Ezra Klein. He is one of the best writers, and I enjoy his beat
around technology and social issues.

He put together a [huge title piece for this month's
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/?gift=o6MjJQpusU9ebnFuymVdsMKo25mQ7_DimWNHAJNoVhY),
about how Americans are spending more time alone. It's a long read, but
a great retelling of the ills of American society and how folks have
fewer friends than we used to:

> Home-based, phone-based culture has arguably solidified our closest
> and most distant connections, the inner ring of family and best
> friends (bound by blood and intimacy) and the outer ring of tribe
> (linked by shared affinities). But it's wreaking havoc on the middle
> ring of "familiar but not intimate" relationships with the people who
> live around us, which Dunkelman calls the village. "These are your
> neighbors, the people in your town," he said. We used to know them
> well; now we don't.

Derek did a [podcast
episode](https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/plain-english-with-derek-thompson/2025/01/10/the-anti-social-century-americas-epidemic-of-solitude-and-how-to-fix-it)
as well, featuring Nick Epley who was interviewed for the piece. It
talks a lot about the value of connecting with people in day to day
life, and how that can meaningfully make you happier and more connected
over time.
