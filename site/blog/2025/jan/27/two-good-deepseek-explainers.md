# Two good Deepseek explainers

The day has been busy with folks talking about Deepseek and it's R1
model. I found a couple posts really useful to understand and
contexutalize it:

-   [The Short Case for Nvidia
    Stock](https://youtubetranscriptoptimizer.com/blog/05_the_short_case_for_nvda) -
    published on Saturday January 25 by Jeffrey Emanuel. It's a long
    post (\~60m read time) that goes through the whole context of R1 in
    great depth, but very readable with a bit of technical knowledge

-   [DeepSeek FAQ](https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/) -
    published today by Ben Thompson, which tries to cover the high level
    takeaways and provide context for the market reaction today which
    was quite large.
