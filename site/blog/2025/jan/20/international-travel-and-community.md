# International travel and community

My wife and I took off from Portland in February 2018, and ended up
working and traveling for \~2 years after that. Luckily in January 2020,
we ended up settling down in Bend, at the planned end of our travels.
We've been here for 5 years now, and we're about ready to take off
again!

## Community

We just told our landlord and jobs that we're planning to travel. Having
done this before, we know that our primary goal will be **building
community**. Traveling with a partner for a year+ starts to become
isolating, especially when you're in countries that you don't speak the
language and have very different cultures.

Last time my wife and I both worked 4 days a week, but this time she is
fully leaving her job. This means she'll be doing a lot more hiking, and
I'm going to have a bit more pressure to spend less time working and
more time exploring! It will be an interesting new dynamic to manage,
but I'm excited to have more chance to see the world.

## Our current plan (March - August)

The current plan is:

-   March 2 - March 9: Atlanta for a Read the Docs offsite.

-   March 10 - April 2: **Turks & Caicos**, visiting family and doing
    some diving and whale watching.

-   April 2 - 7: **Dominican Republic**, mostly just a long layover but
    checking out Santo Domingo and a couple other areas.

-   April 7-29: **Costa Rica**, planning to hike the [Camino de Costa
    Rica](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2025/jan/15/the-camino-de-costa-rica/)
    with our friends Russ & Quyen, along with some other wildlife
    viewing.

-   April 30: **San Francisco** for a dev event, but have some time for
    dinner.

-   April 31 - May 7: **Portland**, [Write the Docs
    Portland](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/).

-   May 7 - May 14: **Virginia**, visiting family.

-   May 15 - May 22: **Pittsburgh**, [Pycon
    US](https://us.pycon.org/2025/).

-   May 23 - \*: **Europe**, likely doing some hiking in the Alps &
    Dolomites, as well as visiting friends in Amsterdam, and a possible
    offsite in Berlin. We also want to hike some in Montenegro, which
    we've heard is great, and isn't in Schengen which is important for
    managing our 90 days there.

I'll plan to update my location regularly, and would love to meet up
with folks and talk hiking, travel, tech, or anything else if you're in
a similar place!
