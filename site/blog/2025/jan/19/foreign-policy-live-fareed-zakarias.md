# Foreign Policy Live: Fareed Zakaria’s ‘Age of Revolutions’

I really enjoyed [this episode of Foreign Policy Live with Fareed
Zakaria](https://overcast.fm/+AA_HMDOVjr0) where he discusses his book
Age of Revolutions.

> "So you start out with the conservatives hating the Industrial
> Revolution because they\'re the party of land and privilege, and
> tradition, and they look upon these new merchants and all this is
> terrible, too much change. By the end of the Industrial Revolution,
> and by the left, by the way, the liberals are the guys pushing forward
> all these nifty new ideas. And by the end of the Industrial
> Revolution, the rows have flipped because the conservatives now become
> comfortable with the new elite, the industrial elite, and the left,
> which had celebrated all this, sees that it causes a lot of turmoil, a
> lot of dislocation for particularly people at the bottom end of the
> spectrum, and they become the party of the working class.
>
> So that\'s the kind of perfect example of how a big structural
> revolution scrambles the politics of the age. The thing I got from it,
> the most important lessons I think are, you should expect these kinds
> of identity revolutions that we\'re in right now when you have
> enormous change. And we have had enormous change over the last 30 or
> 40 years."

The whole interview is quite thought provoking. I tried to read the full
book, and found it a bit more dry and dull than his interview, so I
think the interview is a great first step into the material.
