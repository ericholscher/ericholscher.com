# Staying in Europe (Schengen) longer than 90 days as an American

When we traveled previously in 2018-2019, we spent summer in Europe both
times. In general you are allowed to spend 90 of any 180 days in the
Schengen visa area. This is a huge part of Europe, and was always a rush
against the clock because we'd love to spend more time in Europe.

I've found a way as an American to spend more time in Europe than 90
days, which are **bilateral visa waiver agreements,** which is basically
an agreement that came into effect between the USA and a Schengen
country before the treaty was signed.

I found this information in [this reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/xw9g2l/new_and_updated_guide_to_legally_stay_180_days_in/?share_id=BL5Jo83g45n6xTHcRUEtJ&utm_name=androidcss),
which covers a lot of the background:

> Certain Schengen countries have the Bilateral Agreement law, which

You can find [the official EU
publication](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/c067e92d-5a8b-11e9-9151-01aa75ed71a1)
on this topic, which should be all that you need to show to initiate the
90 additional days, and hopefully on departure as well. It seems like
you can't leave the country that you have the extra 90 days during that
time, but it includes some countries I wouldn't mind spending a lot of
time in like Italy:

> -   **Belgium** - 3 months
>
> -   **Denmark** - 3 months
>
> -   **Spain** - 90 days
>
> -   **France** - 90 days
>
> -   **Italy** - 3 months
>
> -   **Latvia** - 90 days in any half-year period
>
> -   **Hungary** - 90 days
>
> -   **The Netherlands** - 90 days
>
> -   **Norway** - 90 days
>
> -   **Portugal** - 60 days

This is an exiting new piece of information that I wish I'd had back in
2019!
