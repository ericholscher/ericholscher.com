# 31 days of posts

I decided to try and write a blog post each day in January, and have now
been successful! I have been inspired by folks like [Simon
Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), [John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/), and [Andy
Baio](https://waxy.org/). They are able to keep up a rate of sharing
over time, at different levels of depth.

I started out trying to write long blog posts, but have been humbled by
my ability to do that daily. I lowered my inspiration to a link blog,
which is much more workable for a daily post. I read a ton of different
stuff each day, so sharing my favorite things seems like an easy task.
The hard part has been choosing what to write about, whether I want a
"beat" around tech docs or AI, or want to post what is personally
interesting to me.

I'm hoping to continue writing on an almost daily basis, but also want
to give myself permission to not do it each day.
