The best introduction to LLM's I've found
=========================================

I've been getting more and more excited about Large Language Models lately,
and have been inspired by `Simon Willison's <https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/>`_ call for more people to do link blogging.

As I've read more into the subject, I've understood things like Embeddings,
and even talked about how to `operationalize them in Django <https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2024/04/using-embeddings-in-production-with-postgres-django-for-niche-ad-targeting/>`_.

There was still a pretty large gap in my understanding of how transformers worked though,
and I've watched a few Youtube videos and read posts trying to clarify things.
The best resource I found was this post from Understanding AI:

> `Large language models, explained with a minimum of math and jargon
 <https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with>`_

This post covers the topic in a really clear way,
and I really loved this image:

The post overall is a great introduction,
and I recommend reading the whole thing.
