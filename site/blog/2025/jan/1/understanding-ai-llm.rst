The Best Introduction to LLMs I've Found
========================================

I've been getting more and more excited about Large Language Models (LLMs) lately,
and have been inspired by `Simon Willison's <https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/>`_ call for more people to do link blogging.

As I've read more into the subject, I've come to understand concepts like *Embeddings*,
and even discussed how to `operationalize them in Django <https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2024/04/using-embeddings-in-production-with-postgres-django-for-niche-ad-targeting/>`_.

However, there was still a significant gap in my understanding of how transformers work.
I've watched a few YouTube videos and read several posts trying to clarify things.
The best resource I found was this post from Understanding AI:

   `Large language models, explained with a minimum of math and jargon <https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with>`_

This post covers the topic in a really clear way,
and I particularly loved this image:

The post overall is a great introduction,
and I recommend reading the whole thing.
