# Money and Identity

I've seen more and more people in my life retire lately,
and it often comes with a loss of identity.
It's hard to see folks who have been strongly defined by their job lose that identity,
and not have a good sense of how to replace it.

This is a great article from the founder of Loom, Vinay Hiremath,
which talks about this exact issue.

This reminds me of the book [Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49989169-the-psychology-of-money) from Morgan Housel,
which I highly recommend.
It talks about similar themes around money,
and validates a lot of my own personal views on the topic,
which is always nice :)
