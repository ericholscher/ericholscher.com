# Understanding maps

I've always enjoyed maps, and they still kind of blow my mind when I
really think about it. Especially with hiking and international travel,
the sense of space in a place is always something I have a hard time
intuiting, and maps are a starting point to understanding, as well as
geopolitics :)

In terms of understanding how map projections work, I really enjoyed
this video that was linked from [this Slow Boring
post](https://www.slowboring.com/p/last-biden-mailbag?r=21p76&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web):

I'm sure he's just cutting it open for effect, but it's a great visual
that explains the problem, and the visualizations of how different map
projections happen are really well done.

## The true size

This is a great chance to also link to one of my favorite tools: [The
True Size Of](https://www.thetruesize.com/). It allows you take a
specific country or state, and create a shadow image that you can move
around and compare to the size of other places. This is shown using the
projection, so you can get a sense for the size of things.

Here is an example of Texas compared to Alaska, but using the same
projection space:

It's a great way to better understand how big Africa is, and get a real
sense of the relative size of places.
