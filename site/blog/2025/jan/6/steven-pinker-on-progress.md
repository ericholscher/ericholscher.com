# Steven Pinker on Progress

I've enjoyed [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and
[Steven Pinker](https://stevenpinker.com/) for a long time for their
zoomed out perspective on progress in the world.

The talk he gave at the [Progress
conference](https://www.progressconference.com/) that covers his overall
worldview, which is a great introduction to the concept.

> The news is a systematically misleading way to understand the world.
> Not because of any nefarious bias on the part of the media companies
> but because of the very nature of news. News is about stuff that
> happens not stuff that doesn\'t happen, and news is about sudden and
> unexpected, not gradual changes so news by its very nature is a
> non-random sample that will end up being the worst things happening in
> the world.
