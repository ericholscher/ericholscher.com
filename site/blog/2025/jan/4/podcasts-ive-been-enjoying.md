# Podcasts I've been enjoying

## [Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast)

I've been listening to Ezra since his days at Vox, and his podcast is
always a good listen. I appreciate the wide range of topics he covers,
and his guests are always interesting.

## [Stratechery & Sharp Tech (\$)](https://stratechery.com/)

I started reading Ben Thompson's Stratechery a number of years ago, but
mostly listen to his podcast now. The Stratechery podcast is just him
reading his articles, and Sharp Tech is a more conversational podcast
covering similar topics.

## [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm/)

Acquired is a long-form podcast (3-4 hours) that cover the history of
tech companies. It's like an audio version of the autobiography books
that I've also enjoyed reading over the years.

## [Search Engine](https://www.searchengine.show/listen)

This show by PJ Vogt is a great follow up to Reply All where I used to
listen to him. Each episode answers a topic, and they go deep into
various topics with great story telling.

## [Odd Lots](https://www.bloomberg.com/oddlots)

This show by Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway is a great mix of finance
and economics. They interview the "perfect guest" for each episode, and
dive into various topics that I find fascinating.
