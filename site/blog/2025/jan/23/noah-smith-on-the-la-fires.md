I thought this was a great post about our current wild fires and the
reality of insurance in this moment. This is a live issue in Oregon,
where a [state-wide wildfire risk
map](https://www.bendsource.com/opinion/wildfire-risk-maps-are-just-the-start-of-a-new-reality-around-fire-22516505)
is causing an uproar because of the wide risk to people's homes. This
map will hopefully be used to pass regulation around fire hardening
homes, which is an important step towards helping people's homes survive
fires.
