This is a solid post looking at the relative decline in traffic for
Stack Overflow in the last few years. I'm a little worried about
something like this will happen to Read the Docs, but so far we haven't
seen a huge decrease in traffic. I think perhaps being "official docs"
for a project is a bit more resilient than a Q&A site, since it's
serving a slightly different use case. I do think that LLMs have
replaced a lot of Q&A type activity, but there still a need for
canonical reference information like documentation.
