# A NY Times piece on Mt Bachelor

Our [not-so-little local mountain got a write up in the NY
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/mt-bachelor-ski-resort.html),
which is always fun to see. It's about a local effort to try and buy the
mountain (\~\$200M, so some very rich locals..). Lots of funny little
nods to the culture of Bend:

> Mike Rogge, the editor and publisher of the outdoor magazine Mountain
> Gazette, summed up collective feelings in a social media post.
>
> "The ski industry, specifically the resort side, I fear is losing the
> narrative," [he
> wrote](https://www.threads.net/@skiingrogge/post/DEaWNtBvtHE?xmt=AQGz62NRhG0Quny85eT30umUugzroW69jx-6R1OmoyRb6g).
> "Guests are your lifeblood. Locals are your culture. Without either of
> them you're an empty theme park."

The mood on the effort has turned pretty sour on our local reddit page
after it was made clear that locals didn't really have a way to "buy
in". There's still some platitudes about trying to give locals some kind
of share, if it ever happens, which it probably won't.
