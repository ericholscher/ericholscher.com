# Wool & Sand are solid books

We watched the Silo series on Apple TV, and it was pretty solid. I've
gotten into the habit of trying to read books after they make shows
about them, and the books tend to be better than the shows :) In this
case, I enjoyed both.

## [Wool](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus)

This book is the basis of Silo. The book seems to cover the first 2
seasons of Silo the show, and includes a lot of details that the show
leaves out. In particular I really enjoyed the diving sequence in the
book much more than the movie.

There are 3 books in the series, and I have the second on hold at the
library :)

## [Sand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20662430-sand)

I picked this one up after reading Wool because I enjoyed the author. He
has a good knack for writing suspense scenes and building good
characters. Probably my favorite scene in this book is when there is an
action sequence where a house is buried and then gets unburied. I won't
share too many more spoilers than that :)
