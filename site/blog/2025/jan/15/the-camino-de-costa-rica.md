# The Camino de Costa Rica

I'm hoping to do more hiking this upcoming year. Last summer my wife and
I did the [Tahoe Rim Trail](https://tahoerimtrail.org/), which was a
great hike within driving distance. With a goal to do more international
travel, we're looking at doing the [Camino de Costa
Rica](https://www.caminodecostarica.org/) later this year. It sounds
like there are a number of options for places to stay along the route,
so camping is somewhat optional, and lots of local food options.

I found it most interesting that the trail is being promoted by the
local economic development agency. The goal is to get more tourism away
from the coasts and into the interior of the country. Promoting a long
distance trail is a pretty novel way to approach that, but it's also a
similar vision as [Oregon Scenic
Bikeways](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=things-to-do.scenic-bikeways).
With that program, the local towns actually have to petition the state
to get a route, showing community support, and with the goal of economic
development.

I'm hoping we get a chance to hike it it in the upcoming year!
