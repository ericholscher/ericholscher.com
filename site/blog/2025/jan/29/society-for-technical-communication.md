# Society for Technical Communication (STC) shutting down

Today there was some sad news, which is that the STC is shutting down.
They posted a note on [their website](https://www.stc.org/) and other
social media channels:

> Despite significant efforts over the past several years by the various
> Boards of Directors and STC leadership, financial liabilities coupled
> with falling membership numbers have created a situation where we are
> not able to offer the education, resources, and outreach that this
> membership expects and deserves.â€¯Various cost-cutting measures and
> attempts to generate revenue have not been sufficient, and our debt
> and operational expenses now outweigh our ongoing revenue.
>
> --- STC Board of Directors & STC Executive Director Tim Shaw

It also got [picked up on Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867324), which had the
usual mix of valuable and... divisive comments. I ended up commenting to
provide some additional context, which is probably useful to share on
the blog:

> I\'ve been working in this space for a long time, where I\'m one of
> the co-founders of Write the Docs: https://www.writethedocs.org/ \--
> we focus more on software docs.
>
> The view from the industry is basically that STC was a bit behind the
> times, and was slowly dwindling in terms of reach and value. They
> still had some active chapters, magazine, and academic journal that
> provided value for folks, but membership wasn\'t as valuable as it had
> been.
>
> They have been around a long time, and had a wider purview that WTD,
> focusing on many different types of technical writing. They had
> members in industries like Automotive, Engineering, and Aerospace, as
> well as Software.
>
> The best way to think about them is something like the ACM in the
> software industry. They have been taken over by more current community
> approaches in various areas (eg. Pycon), but also still doing some
> more traditional stuff that adds value but isn\'t as relevant to
> day-to-day practitioners.

It's definitely a sad day, and sows more confusion and worry in an
industry that is already pretty stressed by AI. I wish the STC folks the
best of luck trying to shut down the organization, and I hope that Write
the Docs can continue to [carry the
torch](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/write-the-docs_were-saddened-to-hear-that-society-for-technical-activity-7290415417058111488-6xii?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
in some fashion.
