AI search should sustain open source
====================================

Open source funding has been a long standing issue,
and something that I have been working on for almost 15 years now.
Historically the model that has worked the best from what I can tell is:

* Publish open source and get a lot of users
* Put advertising on your website, docs, and other online places
* Let Google index it for free
* Have Google send traffic, which is monetized by ads

`Funding open source with advertising <https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/>`_ is a reasonable model,
which is also how the news and other publishing industries have worked.
However, it requires massive scale to even support a part-time developer,
so we need to find additional revenue streams that scale.

AI search: paying for content
-----------------------------

There are many moral issues with the creation of LLM models and content licensing,
but a recent development has been `OpenAI signing content deals with major publishers <https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167072/openai-content-copyright-vox-media-the-atlantic>`_
This appears to be so that they can include the results in their AI search engine.

This has turned the economics of the model we discussed above on it's head.
Given that coding and knowledge of software is one of the most common uses of AI so far,
it seems that up to date knowledge of software is a valuable asset.

**There is a strong incentive for AI companies to have up to date and canonical knowledge of the software you are using.**
Current open source licenses mean that these companies could just train on the software and not pay for it,
but there seems like an opportunity for them to pay for the content,
similar to what they are doing with news publishing.

In general documentation is also licensed similar to software,
but there is a possibility that a new model comes around that the documentation of software becomes directly monetizable in a way that it hasn't been before.

Making more open source projects sustainable
---------------------------------------------

I would love to talk with any of the major AI companies about a licensing deal for some or all of Read the Docs content.
RTD has lots of documentation for many open source projects related to AI,
and it would be great to have a licensing deal that would allow us to pass along some of the revenue to the projects that we host documentation for.

We have done some testing of this with advertising,
but it required a lot of traffic for any project to get real revenue.
If we can find multiple revenue streams for open source projects,
it would lower the size of project that would become sustainable.

An initiative like this would also likely increase the standing of the AI companies in the tech community,
where many people love their products,
but are skeptical of the usage of IP is foundational to their business model.
