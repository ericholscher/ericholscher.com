Sphinx Live Preview
===================

For a long time, 
there has been a live preview site for reStructuredText: http://rst.ninjs.org/
It is really fantastic for learning the language.
The immediate feedback is really valuable in helping you expirment and see how things work.


I think that this tool would be great for people to have with Sphinx as well.
I know a lot of people use Sphinx,
and then end up on that page,
and random things don't work because they are extensions to reStructuredText.
So, I went ahead and ported the app to support Sphinx.

I present: http://livesphinx.herokuapp.com/

It is still very much a work in progress.
The output should be themed nicely,
and support syntax highlighting.
If you have any feedback or requests,
please `tweet`_ or `email`_ me.

This work was done as part of my :doc:`ongoing work </blog/2013/sep/25/help-me-improve-documentation>` to improve documentation.
If you think this work is important,
you should `support me on Gittip`_.
