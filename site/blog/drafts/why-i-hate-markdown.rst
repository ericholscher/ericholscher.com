Why You Shouldn't Use Markdown for Documentation
================================================

"Markdown" is the most commonly used markup language on the internet.
It is great for a subset of tasks,
mainly blog posts and commenting.
However,
lately it has been adopted by the technical writing community as a solution for writing longer form documents.

I'd like to lay out the main arguments that I have against "Markdown".
Hopefully this will be useful in helping you decide whether it's a good fit for your organization.
If you are considering Markdown,
I hope that you also look at `Asciidoctor`_ and `Sphinx`_.
I find them to be much better toolsets for writing documentation.

.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/

Lack of a standard
------------------

For a long time,
Markdown was defined by the `initial implementation`_ written by John Gruber. 
There was no spec,
and the "proper" behavior was whatever this script chose to do.

As Markdown got more popular,
more and more sites started to implement it.
Those sites were written in other languages,
so more implementations of Markdown were created.
All of these implementations had slight variations in what was accepted.

One example is that some required a space before a heading and others didn't::

	# Heading 1

	#Heading 1

There are a number of small issues that made it hard to port your Markdown between sites and verisons.

In the last few years, `Commonmark`_ was developed as a standardized Markdown.
This is great,
and should solve lots of problems!
Except that nobody has adopted it...

Flavors
-------

The main reason for this lack of adoption is that people using Markdown haven't been sitting still for all these years.
Because the original Markdown is so limited,
every popular tool built on top of Markdown implements what is called a "`flavor`_" of Markdown.
This sounds great,
except that **every tool implements a different flavor**.
Even tools that do similar things with the language use different syntax for it!

For example,
in `Markdown Extra`_ code blocks look like this::

	~~~ .python

	import antigravity

	~~~

This would apply a `python` class to the HTML block that is output.

However,
with `GitHub Flavored Markdown`_ the same example would be::

	```python

	import antigravity

	```

This would apply syntax highlighting to the actual rendered HTML output.

**This is two different syntaxes for a similar concept, both called "Markdown"*	*

Lack of Semantic Meaning
------------------------

Though many people have added extensions to Markdown,
almost none have any kind of semantic meaning.
This means that you can't write a *Note* or a *Warning*,
you can only write text.

This leads people to embed HTML directly in their Markdown:

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="warning">

	This is a Warning!

	</div>

In reStructuredText for example,
you can write:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. warning:: This is a Warning!

Or, in AsciiDoc, you can write:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. WARNING: This is a Warning!

This will be output as a warning properly in HTML, PDF, and any other output format you can generate.

**Semantic markup firmly separates the words that you write from how they are displayed.**

Writing without semantic markup is a problem for a few reasons:

* Your Markdown is now dependent on specific CSS classes in your display, meaning your writers have to think about how your page will be designed
* Your content is no longer portable to other output formats (PDF, etc.)
* Conversion to other markup tools and page designs becomes much harder

Lack of Extensibility
---------------------

With other markup languages,
you can extend the language to provide the features that you need.
They have mechanisms in the syntax to add new functionality,
without breaking from the original spec and creating a new language.

reStructuredText for example,
has both inline and block level markup:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. contents::
	   :caption: Table of Contents

	Please look at :rfc:`1984` for more information.
	This is implemented in our codebase at :class:`Example.Encryption`.

You can learn more about the `rfc <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/inline.html#role-rfc>`_, `class <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html?highlight=domains#cross-referencing-python-objects>`_, and `contents <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents>`_ concepts.

**There is no way of doing this in Markdown,
in a way that would be portable across versions.**

.. note:: CommonMark is working on an `extensibility syntax`_, but it isn't implemented yet.

Lock In and Lack of Portability
-------------------------------

The explosion of flavors and lack of semantic meaning leads to lock in.
Once you've built out a large set of Markdown documents,
it's quite hard to migrate them to another tool,
even if that tool claims to support Markdown!
You have a large set of custom HTML classes and weird flavor extensions that won't work anywhere but the current set of tools and designs.

You also can't migrate them easily to another markup languages (Asciidoc or RST),
because Pandoc and other tools won't support your flavor's extensions.

I think that a lot of people choose Markdown because they think they can migrate to another tool or markup later.
Markdown is definitely the lowest common demoninator,
except that for any reasonably sized set of docs you'll need things that aren't in the basic language.

**Once you start using markdown flavors,
which is required for any non-trivial documentation,
you lose all portability benefits.**

Lack of Scalability
-------------------

Markdown looks easier than AsciiDoc or RST, and you only need simple content, so why fuss with all the complexity? There's all this great out-of-the-box tooling, just install, configure, and go. 
After all, you're just starting out, and the most important thing is to ship the docs. Easy is good. The trouble is, you don't know
when you're starting out just what you'll need down the road. Doc sets have a tendency to grow. You need new types of content you didn't have time to think about with version 1 of the product. You need to support multiple versions. You need to deliver custom doc sets. Marketing has decided to re-brand. All of a sudden, your simple API isn't quite so simple anymore, you're building things on top of it, and you start looking at a CMS.

But either AsciiDoc/Asciidoctor or RST/Sphinx will let you scale beautifully. And you don't have to start out with all
the complexity. Sure, the markup conventions are slightly different, but if all you need initially is some headings, some 
paragraphs, and some code blocks, the learning curve isn't steep.

Conclusion
----------

Please investigate `Sphinx`_ and `Asciidoctor`_ as good alternatives.
They come with a lot more extensibility built into the language,
and are more complete tools for building sets of documentation.

Markdown is a concept more than it is an implementation.
It generally means "a set of incompatible extensions to something that looks kinda like Markdown".
When you are trying to author large sets of documents,
it isn't the correct tool.
