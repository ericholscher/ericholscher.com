Power through conversation
==========================

I feel that I am most able to convey my ideas and gain new ones
through conversation. Viewing a blog as a conversation is
interesting, but I have yet to gain the same value through a blog
as a good conversation in real life. I feel like I ask good
questions, and have a skill in the ability to conduct conversation
well. I feel that this is a good skill, and not something that
needs to be changed. I guess the new skill that needs to be learned
is how to make online 'conversations' more like the real life ones
described above.
