Crazy times
===========

Only have 2 weeks left until presenting at NCUR. I give my honors
project presentation to the UMW Compsci faculty on the Wednesday
before the conference. Lots of work to do, but enjoying it. Getting
to really dig into Django and learn it and understand it's
modularity is awesome. I'm super busy and it feels like real life
is starting...Should be a fun endless summer.

PS Text editors are also cool in a GUI mode over an X connection.
You only update one tiny little place on the screen at a time, and
doesn't reload much of anything. Works much better than firefox,
which is quite the opposite.
