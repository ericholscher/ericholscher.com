Djangocon Talk
==============

I just gave a talk title "Large problems, Mostly solved", which you
will recognize if you've been reading this blog for a little while.
I took my past series of
`Large problems <http://ericholscher.com/tag/largeproblems/>`_
posts, and expanded on them into a full talk.

The video and slides are posted below. Thanks for the A/V team
kicking ass this year and getting the videos posted in amazing
time. Also many thanks to the conference organizers and volunteers
who managed to make it all happen, it was a great time!
