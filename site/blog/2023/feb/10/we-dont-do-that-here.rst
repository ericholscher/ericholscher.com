`We don't do that here`: Setting social norms
=============================================

I have long been a fan of social rules to make events more inclusive.
Ever since I attended my first tech conference,
I've seen the career-enhancing power of events.
In the 10 years that I've been responsible for organizing events,
repeatable rules for inclusion have become one of my primary focuses as an organizer.

Professional events are an amazing opportunity,
but they have never been equally accessible to all people.
There are a number of barriers:
high cost, social anxiety, and lack of representation are the ones that I think about the most.
As organizers we need to be working to improve the spaces that we are responsible for,
and I'd like to share one powerful idea.

Tools for enforcing community norms
-----------------------------------

I came across another wonderful rule that I wanted to write about here.

.. epigraph::

   If no one has told you yet, as your career in tech progresses you will eventually become a “custodian of culture.” If you run a meetup or a team, if you lead an open source project, or if you organize an event people will be looking to you to know what is and isn’t okay in that space. You get this responsibility whether you want it or not. You don’t have to be internet famous to have this responsibility. If there are people you work with who have been around for less time than you, then you are going to help set the culture for them.

   -- **Aja Hammerly**, `We don't do that here <https://thagomizer.com/blog/2017/09/29/we-don-t-do-that-here.html>`_

I really loved this framing, and it spoke to me directly.

The golden rule of community trust
----------------------------------

I've written in the past about the value of having people dedicated to setting culture at your events,
most recently in :doc:`/blog/2015/oct/16/the-importance-of-being-welcoming`.
I think "We don't do that here" tool is a wonderful one for people in the Welcome Wagon,
and other positions of power.

That post didn't have a quotable definition of a rule,
but I'll give it a try:

.. epigraph::

   As a person with a position of power,
   it's your responsibility to enforce community standards.
   "We don't do that here" is your most powerful culture setting tool.

   -- **The golden rule of community trust**

"We don't do that here" allows you to reinforce cultural norms in a way that can't be argued.
It's a powerful tool,
so use it wisely.

**You must enforce community standards if you wish to grow a healthy community.**

I found this concept originally in Chris Holdgraf's `FOSDEM 2023 report <https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2023/fosdem/>`_.
Thanks for sharing it Chris!

Have you found a useful rule or technique for making your events friendlier and more accessible?
I'd love your suggestions on how to spread this idea more widely.
