The festival that felt like a hug
=================================

A story about `XOXO Festival <http://xoxofest.com>`_ in 3 acts. I
will start first with something that set the tone, then talk about
the importance to me, and then what I hope comes from it in the
future.

Act 1: Interjecting awesome
---------------------------

One moment stood out to me in the swirl of ideas and amazing that
was XOXO. It was at the beginning of the conference, when the
organizers were on stage. They were talking about how they wanted
the conference to be experienced. The sentence that I think changed
the entire conference experience for me (paraphrased):

    This should be a conference where you can go up to a group of
    people you don't know, and they will include you in their
    conversation.


This seems like something very simple, but it set an important
social contract. Normally my introverted self will balk at the idea
of joining a group of unknown people. Especially at a conference
with so many people who I look up to and admire. However, this
idea, set forth by the organizers, dispelled this apprehension, and
instead I viewed it as my responsibility to interject.

This was a fundamental change in how I experienced the conference.
I spend most of my time at conferences talking to people I've known
for years, rarely breaking into new groups. At XOXO, though, since
I knew only a few people beforehand and felt compelled to meet new
folks, I spent the entire conference striking up conversations with
complete strangers. This was a profoundly different and amazing
experience.

Act 2: Bring out your trolls
----------------------------

Consuming the world through twitter is not a way to be inspired.
Getting together in a room and seeing people who have changed their
world, and the world for others, is an amazing experience. It
allows you to perceive and appreciate people's aspirations.

I started XOXO in a funk that can only be explained as cynical. I
had heard of Kickstarter and the ilk, but never really invested or
taken the time to fully let the idea wash over me. As the talks
started, and I heard Kickstarter over and over, it at first felt
like a promotion and a buzz word. However, through the genuine
excitement and joy of bringing something new into the world, my
skepticism turned into inspiration.

Greed being destructive was a theme behind the conference, and I
think this is the primary thing that won me over. People were
creating things because they wanted them to exist in the world, and
they had to do it. It wasn't about making money, or getting famous,
but because they had a drive to change a part of life. This drove
the jealousy and skepticism from my heart, and started the search
for the thing in life that I was meant to change.

Act 3: Radiating change
-----------------------

I think that this conference was an amazing view into a world that
could exist. At a high level it was a distancing from the classical
tech world that is so focused on money. A place where we can be
open, share our ideas, successes, and failures. Somewhere that
people can actually introduce something into the world and have
support for it.

During the talk on Kickstarter,
`Yancey <http://www.kickstarter.com/pages/yancey>`_ mentioned that
Portland has been the most successful city on Kickstarter.
Something like $7.5M has been given to creators in the rose city.
On the technical side, we have a burgeoning, but not well formed
start up community. This means that we can form this community into
something that is different than has existed in other places.

As Paul Graham once said,
`each city sends you a message <http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html>`_.
I think that this conference was in some ways a call to action,
that a place like XOXO needs to exist in a more permanent manner. I
think that Portland has a chance of doing this going forward. I
can't, and won't, try to spell out how this could be done. I will
say that I can't imagine another city that is better poised to do
it.

I want Portland to be the place where you come, and think you can
change the world.
