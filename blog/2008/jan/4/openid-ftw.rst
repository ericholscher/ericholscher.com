OpenID FTW
==========

This is why OpenID is such a good idea.

URL based Identifiers

It talks about how we should use URLs instead of E-mail as
identifiers for ourselves. When someone gets ahold of your e-mail,
they can spam the hell out of you. E-mail inherintly has no way
built into it to identify who the send is, so you have to accept
ALL e-mail, and then use other mechanisms to sort out the stuff you
want. With URLs, if you get my URL you get nothing. You know who I
am, but that doesn't inherintly give you any way to contact me. If
you are my friend and you can prove to me that you own a URL that I
know you own, I can then allow you to contact me. This inverts the
basic premise of E-mail, allows for authenticatin, eliminates spam,
and is just a good idea. I'll put my URL on my business card, and
then I'll decide what information you get about me based on other
critera.

This is a very powerful idea, and has the potential to change the
paradigm of web interaction. That's why I'm learning about openID
and such!
