Weekend
=======

Lost the weekend and this week in web land. A friend came to visit,
everyone came back from break, and classes are starting. I will
begin posting regularly again. I read 3 books in the last 2 weeks,
which I posted about earlier. On Intelligence is amazing and has
set my mind racing, expect some good posts coming up in the next
week or two based off of reflection on that.
