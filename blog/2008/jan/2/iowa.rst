Iowa
====

Tomorrow is the Democratic caucus in Iowa. I'm really hoping that
Obama wins, or basically anyone but Clinton. I believe that Edwards
and Obama have the best chance of actually returning this country
to it's basic morals and values, and I certainly plan to vote for
whichever of them wins this primary. I also believe that if Clinton
wins, then it will be the first time in history that an independant
could possibly win the White House. (Obama/Edwards, or Obama/Paul
perhaps?). Here's hoping that faith and morality wins out in this
crazy world of ours, and a chance to put America back in it's
rightful place as a law-abiding and moral country.
