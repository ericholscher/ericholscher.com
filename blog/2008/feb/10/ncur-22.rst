NCUR 22
=======

I got accepted into NCUR. The National Conference on Undergraduate
Research. Here is my abstract. I get to have at least the abstract
published, and maybe the entire paper that I write in support of my
project, still not sure how it works. UMW is paying for me to go,
which is amazing. It should be an awesome opportunity to meet some
people in my field doing interesting things. The presentation there
is the weekend after my Honors Project presentation that I have to
do to graduate with honors. The timing works out well :)
