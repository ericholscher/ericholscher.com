Why I love the CLI
==================

Simple example. I walked into my room today to a picture
screensaver which is awesome. Aparently it uses the Pictures folder
on the Desktop, of which only my latest pictures are in. I want it
to use all of them...

rm Pictures ln -s /store/pics Pictures

With tab completion.

All my pictures are now there :)
