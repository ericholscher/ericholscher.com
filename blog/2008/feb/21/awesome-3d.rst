Awesome 3d
==========

This is an amazing video of some dynamic 3d work a guy did for his
PhD Thesis. Johnny Lee is a PhD student at CMU, and he modified a
display to use the wiimote and a special headset to give real 3D
effects. It actually changes the picture on the screen based on
your proximity and angle to the screen. Amazing.
