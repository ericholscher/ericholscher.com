Bill Clinton
============

Saw Bill Clinton speak on campus today. It was awesome! He is such
a great public speaker. It's amazing to hear a politician say
logical things, backed up with numbers, and actually agree with
their general ideas. What a concept. He hasn't made me want to vote
for Hilary Clinton over Obama (certainly the point), but if she
does win over Obama, I will feel genuinely better about voting for
her in the national election. Bill is an amazing speaker, and was
funny and serious at the correct times. Very well done. It lasted
over an hour, and the turnout was amazing. There was a line halfway
down our entire campus! Very cool.
