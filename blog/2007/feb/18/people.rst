It's amazing the difference having one person in your life can make
or break your entire existence. Usually this would apply to a
significant other, but a best friend is just as valuable if not
more. Went to JMU for less than 24 hours with a good friend from
school; to meet my best friend since second grade. We all got along
marvelously and it was one of the best nights i've had in a long
while. My spirits are high, I feel motivated, and my faith in
humanity has once again been restored.
