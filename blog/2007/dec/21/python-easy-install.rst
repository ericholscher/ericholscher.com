Python Easy Install
===================

EDIT: Hey everyone, I wrote an updated post that actually tells how
to setup a django app (and any python app) using easy install.
Check it out!

I found a neat python module that lets you install other python
modules. I have set it up on here, and it makes it really easy to
install all of the things that I need for my projects. Yey..
