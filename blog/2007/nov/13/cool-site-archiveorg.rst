Cool site: archive.org
======================

The Internet Archive is one of the neatest sites on the internet. I
like them for a variety of reasons. First and foremost is the live
music archive, they currently have 44,134 live concerts posted on
their website. Completely free to download/stream til your hearts
content. Most of the bands I like these days are on there, and they
have an extensive Grateful Dead collection.

They also archive lots of other things, including websites, video,
and documents. The main page gives you a partial list of all of the
things that they are archiving. Really neat stuff.
