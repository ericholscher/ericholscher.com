Announcing Write the Docs
=========================

Documentation is one of the most important parts of a software
project. However, a lot of projects have little or no documentation
to help their (potential) users use the software. A few years ago
we started `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ to help make
hosting documentation easier. Part of the reason was that if
hosting documentation was a solved problem, it would make people
more likely to write docs.

However, there is still a large hole in the documentation world
around writing documentation. There are some resources about it,
but they are scattered around the internet in random places.
`Write the Docs <http://conf.writethedocs.org>`_ is trying to solve
this problem by getting all of the people that care about
documentation in a room, to improve the art and science of
documentation.

Write the Docs is two things. The first and more immediately
interesting is that it is a
`two day conference <http://conf.writethedocs.org>`_ in Portland,
Oregon. Held on April 8-9,
**it will bring the community that exists around documentation together.**
Through this event we will spread a lot of knowledge about how,
why, and when to write documentation.

The second part of the project is a
`resource <http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for people
who are writing documentation. It will solve the problems of
someone who has the question:
**I want to write docs, but what do I write?!**. It will be a home
of best practices around documentation, and a lot more. We hope it
will serve as a growing resource of all things documentation. We
want to build the canonical source for people who have questions
about documentation, and to further the art of documentation in all
forms.

Write the Docs will also
`be a community <http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/latest/about/community.html>`_
that you can become involed in. We are announcing a mailing list
that will serve as a place to ask questions, and bring together all
those who write the docs. In addition, the
`Write the Docs Sphinx repository <https://github.com/writethedocs/docs>`_
is open source, and accepting contributions to the information
there.

All of the above is a work in progress. I hope you join me in
supporting and contributing these projects. I believe that they
will advance the state of the software community in many ways. The
`vision <http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/latest/about/vision.html>`_
for the project lays out some of the things that we want to
accomplish.

Remember: Docs or it didn't happen :)
