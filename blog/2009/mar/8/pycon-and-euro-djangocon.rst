Pycon and Euro Djangocon
========================

The ice is starting to thaw and I'm making my way out from under my
first winter in Kansas. You know that spring is coming because the
conference season is starting to bloom. I'm looking forward to a
bunch of conferences that will be upcoming in the new few months.
I'll be attending two of them, and hope to see lots of interesting
people there!

Pycon
~~~~~

First up is `Pycon <http://us.pycon.org/2009/about/>`_, which is
happening at the end of March. I am really excited to be going,
seeing some of the
`great talks <http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/talks/>`_ that
are planned, and meeting some of the
`awesome people <https://us.pycon.org/2009/register/default/attendees>`_
in the community.

Following the conference, there will also be a
`Django <http://us.pycon.org/2009/sprints/projects/django/>`_
sprint that I will be attending. I know the 1.1 release candidate
of Django is supposed to be released some time during the sprints,
so that will be exciting!

Euro Djangocon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I submitted a talk that was accepted for
`Euro DjangoCon <http://euro.djangocon.org/blog/2009/03/05/confirmed-speakers-so-far/>`_
that I am really excited about. I will be talking about Testing in
the Django realm, which I think is one of the areas where our
community needs to improve. I'm looking forward to having
discussions with people about how we can make testing (even more)
amazing in Django. It will be a great opportunity to get to Prague,
and enjoy the European Django Community that I have only met
online.

The conference talks will be on May 4-6. There will also be two
days of sprints after this one, which I assume will be used to
brainstorm and get some neat things started for Django 1.2.

I'm really looking forward to these conferences, and I hope that
everyone can get a chance to come out and participate in the
discussion about Django and the community.
