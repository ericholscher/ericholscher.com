Django's Summer of Code students announced!
===========================================

Today is the day that Google has announced the accepted projects
for the Summer of Code. Django has 6 spots this year, with a bunch
of exciting projects. I am lucky enough to be mentoring
`Kevin Kubasik <http://kubasik.net/blog/>`_ with his project
"Upgrade the Awesomness Quotient of the Django Test Utils and
Regression Suite". I'm really excited for the opportunity to help
improve Django by overseeing Windmill testing of the admin, and
lots of other small testing improvements that will hopefully make
it into trunk.

I would like to congratulate all the students that got accepted,
and to everyone who didn't, you can still contribute! Also remember
that contributing through the year will make the chance of you
being accepted next year a lot higher! Here is the full list of
accepted proposals:

Honza Král, "Model aware validation" Mentor: Joseph Kocherhans

Kevin Kubasik, "Upgrade the Awesomness Quotient of the Django Test
Utils and Regression Suite" Mentor: Eric Holscher

Christopher Cahoon, "Improved HTTP and WSGI Support" Mentor:
Malcolm Tredinnick

Zain Memon, "UI improvements for the admin interface" Mentor: Jacob
Kaplan-Moss

Marc Albert Garcia Gonzalo, "Implementation of additional i18n
features" Mentor: Jannis Leidel

Alex Gaynor, Multiple Database Support in Django Mentor: Russell
Keith-Magee

Note that you can view the
`full list with abstracts <http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/django>`_
on Google's site.

Looking forward to a summer full of great new features and amazing
community involvement for Django and all the organizations
participating. A big thank you to Google and
`Jannis Leidel <http://jannisleidel.com/>`_ for sponsoring and
administering Summer of Code, respectively.
