Two roads diverage in a yellow wood...
======================================

Two and a half years ago I was given an awesome opportunity to
leave Virginia, and come to Kansas. To most this seems like a death
sentence, but I landed in one of the
`loveliest places <http://www.lawrence.com/>`_ and with some of the
`best <http://www.flickr.com/photos/webology/4601396605/>`_
`people <http://www2.ljworld.com/photos/2010/apr/22/190811/>`_ I've
had the pleasure to know.

It all started with a senior project at `UMW <http://umw.edu>`_
that used Django, which I fell in love with. I really started to
fall in love with Django when James Bennett did a blog series in
`November 2007 <http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/nov/>`_, which
got me hooked. As you may have noticed, I have been doing a
blog-post-a-weekday every November for the past 3 years, because I
think it's a great thing, and is now more of a tradition for me. I
hope that a lot of people have gotten value out of these posts, and
hopefully it has spurred people to do something awesome.

Anyway, back to how I ended up in Lawrence: I posted a
`short summary <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jun/21/job/>`_ of
the series of events back when it happened. The part that I left
out is that part that actually made me apply for the job. It was
Jacob's
`heartfelt post about leaving <http://jacobian.org/writing/sailing-on/>`_
the `Journal-World <http://ljworld.com/>`_. It only seems fitting
that Jacob and I have gone on to become friends.

As you could probably guess with the lead up, I'm leaving the
Journal-World at the end of November. I will be joining the awesome
team at `Urban Airship <http://urbanairship.com/team/>`_ in
Portland, Oregon, a little closer to my natural habitat (Surfing in
Portland isn't quite so silly).

As Jacob said above, leaving the Journal-World is one of the
hardest things I've had to do. It has been the birth of my
professional career, and I owe a lot to the people here. The
basement of the newsroom is also hallowed ground, being where
Django was originally created. I may have turned the
`basement <http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubernostrum/4401561841/>`_
into
`a jungle <http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubernostrum/4187395699/>`_,
but I will always remember working there.

In the spirit of continuing the chain of amazing opportunities, I
would be remiss to not mention that we have a couple of
`open positions <http://jobs.github.com/companies/Mediaphormedia>`_
that we have at the moment. If you are an awesome Django developer,
or like me, a dumb kid that just graduated college but has
ambition, I can't think of many better places to work. Lawrence is
a great town, and the team here is first rate.
