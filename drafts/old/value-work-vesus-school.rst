Value of work vesus school
==========================

There is a lot that you learn in college. More probably out of a
classroom than in it. More probably in a classroom that will only
be valid in a classroom, than outside it. But I still believe that
going to college is a worthwhile thing to do. I wouldn't call it
important, but I would say that those thinking of skipping it, are
missing out on a lot of things.
