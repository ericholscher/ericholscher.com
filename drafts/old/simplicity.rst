Simplicity
==========

Simplicity seems to be a "good thing". I have heard art described
as the art in which you learn to achieve the most simple design.
Simplicity in all things is known as Occam's Razor, and it is
considered a good theory. Simplicity in computer science yields
better performance and easier maintance and understanding.

Rephrase (invert) Occam's Razor. Is the un-simplest explanation (or
interpretation(or manifestation)) ever better? Why?

In art, simplicity is also the act of distilling. 200 Proof alcohol
is distilled all the way. The maker of said alcohol would be said
to be an artisan.

I was talking to a friend who is an artist. We were talking about
the idea of simplicity and how it applies to his paintings. He said
that his favorite paintings were worked on backwards. He would try
to put all that he was thinking into the painting, and it would
become jumbled. Then having to work backwards to distill the
message.

Most good pieces of art evoke an emotion, tell a story, have a
message. This should be singular, a powerful and direct thing. A
distillation of all that could have been into what it is. Whether
it be a combination of ideas into a powerful message, or some other
thing. The message need not be simplistic, but simple.
