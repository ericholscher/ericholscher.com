Putting the Dev in Devops
=========================

I have been doing this whole operations thing for a while now.
Coming from a development background, with a focus in the testing
realm, I have seen some interesting parity between the two
practices. This blog post is going to be me braindumping, with a
little speculation thrown in for good measure. I hope you enjoy
it.

With chef, you only really get functional tests. Unit tests are too
fragile.
