Using Munin with Django Kong
============================

Jacob Kaplan-Moss likes to write micro-frameworks. Luckily, he
wrote a microframework for Python and Munin over on
`Github <http://github.com/jacobian/munin-plugins>`_. I was looking
for a neat way to graph my Kong test duration results, and stumbled
across this nifty little piece of code. So I went ahead and wrote a
Munin plugin for Kong.
