I've seen more and more people in my life retire lately, and it often
comes with a loss of identity. It's hard to see folks who have been
strongly defined by their job lose that identity, and not have a good
sense of how to replace it.

This is an article from the founder of Loom, Vinay Hiremath, which talks
about this exact issue. He wanders between multiple different areas to
focus, and ends up still not really knowing what to do with his life.
It's an interesting salve to the idea that money will solve all your
problems. It seems like he still doesn't know what will solve his, but
it's a perennial question that many people face.

This reminds me of the book [Psychology of
Money](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857199099/) from Morgan
Housel, which I highly recommend. It talks about similar themes around
money, and validates a lot of my own personal views on the topic, which
is always nice :)
