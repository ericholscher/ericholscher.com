# The Best Introduction to LLMs Iâ€™ve Found

I've been getting more and more excited about Large Language Models
(LLMs) lately, and have been inspired by [Simon
Willison's](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) call for
more people to do link blogging.

As I've read more into the subject, I've come to understand concepts
like *Embeddings*, and even discussed how to [use them in
Django](https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2024/04/using-embeddings-in-production-with-postgres-django-for-niche-ad-targeting/).

However, there was still a significant gap in my understanding of how
transformers work. I've watched a few YouTube videos and read several
posts trying to clarify things. The best resource I found was this post
from Understanding AI:

> [Large language models, explained with a minimum of math and
> jargon](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with)

This post covers the topic in a really clear way, and I particularly
loved this image:

The post overall is a great introduction, and I recommend reading the
whole thing.

It seems fitting that my first link blog post of 2025 is about LLMs, and
inspired in multiple ways by Simon :)
